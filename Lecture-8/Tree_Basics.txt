Terminologies associated with Binary Trees and Types of Binary Trees

    -   Node: It represents a termination point in a tree.
    -   Root: A treeâ€™s topmost node. 
    -   Parent: Each node (apart from the root) in a tree that has at least one sub-node of its own is called a parent node.
    -   Child: A node that straightway came from a parent node when moving away from the root is the child node.
    -   Leaf Node: These are external nodes. They are the nodes that have no child.
    -   Internal Node: As the name suggests, these are inner nodes with at least one child.

Tree Types:
Full Binary Tree: This is a tree in which every node has either zero children or two children.
Complete Binary Tree: This is a tree in which all levels are fully filled, except for possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right. 
Skewed Binary Tree: This is a tree in which all the nodes have only either one child or no child.

Intro:
It is an unordered collection of objects in which duplicate values cannot be stored.

Syntax:
Set<Obj> set = new HashSet<Obj> (); 

Methods:
- add(element)
- contains(element)
- isEmpty()
- remove(element)
- size()
etc.

Types:
- HashSet (The objects are inserted based on their hashcode.)
- LinkedHashSet (lets us iterate through the elements in the order in which they were inserted.)
- TreeSet (it stores elements in a sorted format.)
etc.
